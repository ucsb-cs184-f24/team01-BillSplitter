## Task Updates

- **Joseph Li**: Still focusing on the database, exploring MongoDB as a potential solution, while also contributing to other areas of development as needed.
- **Adil/Aneesh**: Working on the creation of OAuth, considering Firebase for user authentication (via email/password, Google, Facebook, or phone), while also collaborating on other aspects of the project. Ideally, want to meet with Joseph at some point this weekend to set everything up
- **Olivia/Nadav**: Working on the Image-to-Text API, evaluating existing APIs like Google Cloud Vision or OCR.space, while also supporting other team efforts. Olivia will be at Grace Hopper this weekend so she will work remotely to get this done

## Things to Consider

Continue brainstorming features, allocating tasks across all group members to ensure everyone contributes to various areas. Start with a minimal viable product and expand based on time management and progress.
