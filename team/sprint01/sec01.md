# Goals for sprint 1

## Start FE and Have all logic done locally(simple does not need to be good just a functional first design)
* Table of items
* List of people
* way to assign people to items (Maybe give each person a color and color bars appear next to items they are assigned)
* price splitting logic maybe think about taxes(can be diff person from FE design)
## BE: have a working API call that can get item and price data from receipts
* find a service, preferably free, that can do image-to-text for receipts
## Database 
* think about db design group items, individual items, the amount paid, the amount due, etc
* Review design with others before committing to db design, and writing functions
* seed test database
* create db functions to populate/interact with DB

## if extra time/someone needs work to do:
* start thinking about / designing individual account logic
* adding friends and grouping
