## Task Updates

- **Joseph Li, Adil, Aneesh**: Meet in the library and created a Firebase project to do user authentication (via email/password, Google, Facebook, or phone)
- **Olivia/Nadav**: Still researching the Image-to-Text API deciding between Google Cloud Vision or OCR.space, trying to understand the use cases of each to see which one would be better for the project. Olivia is working remotely with Nadav to get this done
- **Alex/Yerassyl**: Still working on the design tasks, contributing to feature development and integration across the project. (Yera - navigation) 

## Things to Consider
Want to drill down the basic use case present to understand how to build the app. Leaning towards to run the text to image API, then manually have the group assign who bought who with a drop down menu of everyone in the group to split the bill evently. Still thinking about whether to integrate payments into the platform or just leave that to another service like Venmo
