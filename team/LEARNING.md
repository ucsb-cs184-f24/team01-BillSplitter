Aneesh Agarwal: I have a strong background using Python for full stack development and machine learning, although I have also worked with Java and C++  on some full stack developmnet projects before. I mainly like to use Django and React to build any projects, although I'm open to trying to learning new languages.    

Adil Ahmed: My experiences include 3 software engineer internships, one at Dropbox, an AI startup, and at UCSB ITS! I am most proficient in Python and Typescript and have interests in full-stack applications and machine learning/AI!

Olivia - My incoming knowledge and interests revolve around ML. I have two internship experiences, with one in the ML-for-healthcare space, where I predicted hypertension based off of 
electronic health record data, and one in the financial transaction space, where I implemented a scam detection model to prevent fraud in Apple Wallet. I have limited app development experience from a previous 24-hour hackathon, where I mainly helped with the backend for an ingredients-to-recipe app, and from CS156.

Nadav: knowledge in react native and incorporating different APIs into mobile apps from CS 148 as well as scrum and agile development. Worked with expo in order to create mobile apps in react native

Alex: Full Stack dev in react, do leetcodes in python, familiar with calling LLM apis, experience with scrum dev from previous internship and cs 154

Yerassyl: I have a strong background in Python and C++. I have limited knowledge of mobile development but I have a great knowledge using web development for projects. 

Joseph: I have a background in Java backend development using Springboot, and have also done work using typescript and angular but forgot most of it. I have done personal projects in python. I'd like to get into ml/ai and create an LLM but that seems a bit out of reach as my math fundamentals are terrible.

## React Native Benefits and Challenges (updated 10/11)

### Benefits
* cross platform compatibility
* many 3rd party libraries and large ecosystem
* very popular so lots of documentation and tutorials

### Challenges
* limited access to native APIs
* inconsistencies across platforms
* depending mostly on 3rd party libraries
