# Date of Retrospective: 10/18/24

* Led by: Liv
* Present: Liv, Nadav, Joseph, Aneesh, Remote: Alex, Adil, Yerassyl 

## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at.
  -> We want to find more times to work together as a team. I think that we have gotten good work done individually and we communicate well on Slack, but sometimes there are communication gaps as a result of not being together to discuss our progress on different things.
  -> We want to communicate what we're doing more
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together:
  -> We should have at least two times a week where we can all meet together in a common place to work. I'm thinking a good time to do this is during/right after class since we are already all together or just find a designated period of time at the library where we can work together or even book a study room so there is space for everyone in the group.
  -> Doing the standups as a whole instead of in smaller groups
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.
  -> Looking at the progress of tasks on the Kanban boards would be a great way to do this since we can count the number of tasks that are being done. Also, we can track how much things have changed in every standup to see if people have made progress or if they are stuck on the same task.
  -> Scribe can write that we did the standup as a whole group or not.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro: Just a quick reminder that our MVP is due in two weeks so make sure to keep making progress on the Kanban boards!

## Retro Assessment
* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:
  -> We talked and I asked what we thought we could improve as a group, each taking turns sharing our thoughts.
* A brief assessment of how it went:
  -> Well! We agreed on what we could improve on and came up with changes together.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
  -> Use the group to get feedback and just make sure you follow the directions on Canvas to not forget anything
