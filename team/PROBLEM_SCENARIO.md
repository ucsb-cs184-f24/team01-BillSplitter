App Idea:
Our proposed app idea is designed to simplify the process of splitting grocery bills and other shared expenses among friends. 
Users can create groups for different shopping trips or events, where they can easily log expenses, track who owes what, 
and ensure that everyone pays what they owe. The app offers features such as automatic calculations for shared costs, 
payment integrations for easy transfers, and notifications to remind users about outstanding balances. By providing a 
user-friendly interface, the app aims to enhance the social experience of shopping and eliminate the stress associated 
with managing shared expenses.

Problem Scenario:
A group of friends frequently goes grocery shopping together but often faces challenges in keeping track of expenses. 
After each trip, disputes arise regarding who paid for what, leading to confusion and feelings of unfairness among the group. 
As a result, some people may not want to pay for the initial bill as they feel their frineds won't pay them for what they bought. 
Situation not only strains friendships but also discourages future group shopping trips. The app seeks to 
address these issues by providing a straightforward solution that enhances communication, fosters transparency, and streamlines 
the process of splitting bills, ultimately improving the overall experience of sharing expenses.
